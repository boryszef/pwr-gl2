### Genetrospector

Our genes determine who we are and how we behave. Even more, our genes have something to say about our surroundings too. The _extended phenotype_ is a concept that refers to the phenomenon like the male bowerbird building a spectacular bower to enhance its rather non-impressive look. On the other hand, we are not slaves to our genes. We and our surroundings, our family and friends can shape our personality.

The *Big 5* model contains the five major personality traits:
* openness
* conscientiousness
* extraversion
* agreeableness
* neuroticism

As the scientific reports indicate, our genes determine to a certain extent these personal characteristics. Now, you could be asking yourself questions like: am I open to new experiences? Am I an extrovert or an introvert? Am I living up to my genes? And what others think about me? How they perceive my personality?

It's time to try the *Genetrospector*!  *Genetrospector* is all about understanding your own personality. It uses and
compares four sources of data:
* your genetic traits from Genomelink API,
* introspective questionnaire that measures your Big 5 traits in an unbiased manner,
* your subjective view of your own personality,
* an assessment of your traits made by your friends, based on a questionnaire.

What next? Now that you know who you are and how others see you, you may want to change yourself. We want to help with that too! In the upcoming versions of the application we plan to add new features, like a personal guard who will help and advise you in this great challenge of shaping your new self.

Have fun with *Genetrospector* and stay tuned for updates!
